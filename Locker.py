class Locker(object):
    """
    This is the old Locker implemenetation. It's not removed for back compatibility.
    Using ServerLocker and SingleLocker is a much more robust implementation and
    is process, thread and OS safe. ServerLocker will also work between connected
    machines on the network. Locker can be used for general locking purposes and
    more specifically to lock a file from reading or writing to whoever that doesn't
    have the lock pass.

    :Parameters:
        #. filePath (None, path): The file that needs to be locked. When given and a lock
           is acquired, the file will be automatically opened for writing or reading
           depending on the given mode. If None is given, the locker can always be used
           for its general purpose as shown in the examples.
        #. lockPass (string): The locking pass.
        #. mode (string): This is file opening mode and it can be any of
           'r','r+','w','w+','a','a+'. If filePath is None, this argument will not be
           discarded.
        #. lockPath (None, path): The locking file path. If None is given the locking file
           will be automatically created to '.lock' in the filePath directory. If
           filePath is None, '.lock' will be created in the current working directory.
        #. timeout (number): The maximum delay or time allowed to successfully set the
           lock. When timeout is exhausted before successfully setting the lock,
           the lock ends up not acquired.
        #. wait (number): The time delay between each attempt to lock. By default it's
           set to 0 to keeping the aquiring mechanism trying to acquire the lock without
           losing any time waiting. Setting wait to a higher value suchs as 0.05 seconds
           or higher can be very useful in special cases when many processes are trying
           to acquire the lock and one of them needs to hold it and release it at a high
           frequency or rate.
        #. deadLock (number): The time delay judging if the lock was left out mistakenly
           after a system crash or other unexpected reasons. Normally Locker is stable
           and takes care of not leaving any locking file hanging even it crashes or it
           is forced to stop by a user signal.



    .. code-block:: python

            import uuid
            from pylocker import Locker

            #  create a unique lock pass. This can be any string.
            lpass = str(uuid.uuid4())

            # create locker instance.
            FL = Locker(filePath=None, lockPass=lpass)

            # try to acquire the lock
            acquired, code = FL.acquire_lock()

            # check if acquired.
            if acquired:
                print("Lock acquired")
                print("In this if statement block I can do whatever I want before releasing the lock")

                print("Unable to acquire the lock. exit code %s"%code)
                print("keep this block empty as the lock was not acquired")

            # now release the lock.

    The above example can also be done using 'with' statement

            with FL as r:
                # r is a tuple of three items. the acquired result, the aquiring code and
                # a file descriptor fd. fd will always be None when filePath is None.
                # Otherwise fd can be a real opened file descriptor when acquired is
                # True. In this particular case fd is always None regardless whether
                # the lock was successfully acquired or not because filePath is None.
                acquired, code, fd  = r


                # check if acquired.
                if acquired:
                    print("Lock acquired, in this if statement do whatever you want")
